# json-generator

A web-based JSON generator that I created to make JSON files from an arbitrary format easier. This code lets you define
a basic template for a JSON file, then creates a custom form that outputs JSON for that format in a user-friendly manner.
Certain complex form options have been manually coded, but a majority of basic features such as numbers, strings, comma-separated
arrays, dropdown inputs, buttons, and checkboxes should be handled easily. Custom parsing and output functions are available
for more complex features.
